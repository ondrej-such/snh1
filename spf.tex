\abstract{Label shift is one kind of distribution shift affecting classification models. Generally, one uses transformation inspired by Bayes classifiers to 
adjust predictions of probabilistic classification models. However, there is an ambiguity how to apply this transformation in the case of  probabilistic models built in one-vs-one (also called pairwise) fashion. One-vs-one classification relies on the choice of a coupling method. Some coupling methods -- called Bayes covariant --  are not affected by the ambiguity. Adopting a Bayes covariant method would be the ideal solution to the ambiguity. However, the most commonly used coupling  method of Wu-Lin-Weng is not Bayes covariant. In our study we present elements of theory of coupling methods and exhibit new Bayes covariant coupling methods. One class is formed by arboreal methods. Still more methods can be formed by the way of ensembling. We compare their performance with that of Wu-Lin-Weng's coupling method. In majority of cases, it is possible to find a Bayes covariant method matching performance of Wu-Lin-Weng's method. }
